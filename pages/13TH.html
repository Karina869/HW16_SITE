			The Thirteenth Doctor is a bright, buzzing ball of energy – hyperactive, excitable, and talking a mile a minute from the very first moment we meet her. Filled with wonder and admiration for the universe, she’s a charming explorer who champions fairness and kindness wherever and whenever she can. In her own words, ‘When people need help, I never refuse.’
		</p>
		<p>
			After crash-landing to Earth, still dazed from an explosive regeneration, this Doctor initially struggled to remember who she was. But with help from Grace, Graham, Ryan and Yaz, she soon remembered, and was leaping from great heights and diving into deep space in no time.
		</p>
		<p>
			This Doctor treats her friends like her family – or her ‘fam’, as she often puts it. After many travels across time and space (and face-offs with the Daleks, the Cybermen, and the Master), she said a reluctant goodbye to Graham and Ryan – and a big hello to new companion and proud Liverpudlian, Dan Lewis.
		</p>
		<p>
			Most recently, the Flux saw this Doctor questioning her identity and desperate for answers about her past. But her bravery and selflessness eventually helped her to defeat the Ravagers and the Sontarans, saving the Earth once again alongside new friends Vinder, Bel, Karvanista, and Joseph Williamson.
		</p>
		<p>
			Like her previous incarnations, the Doctor is brave and selfless – a hero who will run towards danger without hesitation. Though she may be a fidget and a wanderer, she’ll always answer a call for aid when she hears it.
